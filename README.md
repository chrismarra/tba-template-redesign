The Blue Alliance Redesign
====================================


### Known Issues
+ Menubar looks weird when the browser window is narrow
+ Robot picture should have simpleviewer enabled

### Changelog
+ got rid of the home tab ("The Blue Alliance" already does this, why do you need another redundant button?)
+ converted awards over to a table, and if no awards, say "None"
+ add formal name in team info
+ robot picture added
